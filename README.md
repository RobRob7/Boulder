Boulder is a fast-paced endurance game built with Godot 4.3, featuring two adrenaline-fueled modes that test your speed and accuracy.

You play as a lone character struggling to push a massive boulder up a hill before time runs out. The clock is always ticking, and when it hits zero, the boulder rolls back and crushes you.

- Mode 1 – Normal: Mash the space bar as fast as you can to rack up points before the timer hits zero. Each press adds a little more time, keeping the chaos going as long as your fingers can keep up.

- Mode 2 – Randomized: Stay sharp and hit the correct key displayed on screen before time runs out! Each correct press rewards you with bonus time.

With simple controls, clean visuals, and addictive time-based challenges, Key Rush is a quick test of focus and reflexes that’s easy to play but hard to master.
